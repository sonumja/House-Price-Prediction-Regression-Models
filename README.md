# House-Price-Prediction-Regression-Models
The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on regression model. Below are the column/features in the data file:
id
date
price
bedrooms
bathrooms
sqft_living
sqft_lot
floors
waterfront
view
condition
grade
sqft_above
sqft_basement
yr_built
yr_renovated
zipcode
lat
long
sqft_living15
sqft_lot15

Following regression models were used to predict price:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Linear Regression
4. SVR - Support Vector Regression
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

Model performance criteria: R Squared
